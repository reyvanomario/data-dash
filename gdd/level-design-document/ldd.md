# Outline/Objectives

## General

What is the overall goal, purpose, and progression of the levels?

## Level 1

What is the purpose and structure of this level?

# Research

What are the inspirations for this games level design? What prototypes and experiments have been done? What file formats have been tested/used?

This section can prove to be valuable in looking back at past experiments on the project.

Make sure to include moodboards of inspirations, prototypes, or experiments.

# Implementation

## General

What are some general implementations, rules, or boundaries for the game levels? What are the world measurements? How will the player progress and win levels?

## Level 1

What are some implementations, rules, or boundaries for this level? How will the player progress? What is unique, achievable, difficult, and gained with this level?
